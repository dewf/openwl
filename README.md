# OpenWL
**The Open Windowing Library**

This is a cross-platform (win/mac/linux) library for:

- top-level window creation
- native menus
- events (mouse, keyboard, etc)
- clipboard / DnD

It's meant to be a foundation for new GUIs, in any language that can interface with a C API. 

See `examples/apidemo/source/main.cpp` for a demonstration of the API.

More soon!
